# REST API Security Assessment

Based on [OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)

## âœ… Implemented Security Controls

### 1. HTTPS
- Using HTTPS endpoints via Nginx configuration
- TLS protocols properly configured (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3)
- Strong cipher suites enforced

### 2. Access Control
- Centralized authentication via JWT tokens
- Role-based access control implemented (user, admin roles)
- Protected routes using middleware

### 3. JWT Implementation
- JWT used for access control
- Token expiration implemented
- Role-based claims included

### 4. HTTP Methods Restriction
- Explicit HTTP methods defined for each endpoint
- Methods properly restricted based on resource type
- OPTIONS handling implemented in Nginx

### 5. Security Headers
- CSP headers configured in Nginx
- HSTS enabled
- X-Frame-Options set
- X-XSS-Protection enabled
- X-Content-Type-Options set

### 6. CORS
- Specific CORS configuration implemented
- Allowed origins explicitly defined
- Credentials handling configured
- Methods and headers properly restricted

### 7. Rate Limiting
- Basic rate limiting implemented via middleware
- Nginx rate limiting as additional layer

### 8. Error Handling
- Generic error messages in production
- Proper HTTP status codes used
- No sensitive information in error responses

## ðŸš§ Partially Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- Basic validation for user inputs
- Need more comprehensive validation for all endpoints

### 2. Content Type Validation
- Basic content type handling
- Need explicit validation for request/response types

### 3. Audit Logging
- Basic request logging implemented
- Need more detailed security event logging

## Missing Controls

### 1. API Keys
- No API key implementation for public endpoints
- Consider implementing for rate limiting and tracking

### 2. Sensitive Information in Requests
- Need to review all endpoints for potential sensitive data exposure
- Implement additional checks for sensitive data in URLs

## Recommendations

1. Implement comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
2. Add API key authentication for public endpoints
3. Enhance audit logging for security events
4. Add explicit content type validation
5. Review and update error messages to ensure no sensitive data leakage
6. Implement request size limits
7. Add more granular rate limiting based on user/IP
8. Consider implementing mutual TLS for highly privileged endpoints

## Notes

The current implementation provides a good security foundation but needs enhancements in specific areas. Priority should be given to implementing comprehensive input validation and API key authentication for public endpoints.

Regular security assessments should be conducted as new features are added to ensure maintaining security standards.
